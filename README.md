# Liquidity Protocol on Radix DLT

Welcome to Gable's repository! This open-source project aims to provide a decentralized liquidity solution built on the Radix Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The protocol facilitates the exchange of digital assets, enabling users to provide liquidity and participate in trading activities.

## Features

- **Decentralized Liquidity:** The protocol enables decentralized liquidity pools where users can contribute their assets to provide liquidity for trading pairs.
- **Flash Loans:** The protocol will offer a variety of lending products. Currently, the main feature will be flash loans.
- **Trading Interface:** Users can interact with the liquidity protocol through a user-friendly web-based interface, allowing for seamless asset swaps and liquidity provision.
- **Incentive Mechanisms:** The protocol implements incentive mechanisms to reward liquidity providers and ensure the sustainability and growth of the liquidity ecosystem.
- **Integration with Radix DLT:** The protocol leverages the Radix DLT infrastructure for secure and scalable transaction processing and consensus.
